      Intel introduced a new software for Windows PCs called Thunderbolt Share
      on Wednesday. This further enhances PC-to-PC connectivity experiences when
      two devices are connected over Thunderbolt 4 or Thunderbolt 5
      technologies.
    </p>
    <br /><br />
    <p>
      Thunderbolt Share utilises the high bandwidth and low latency of
      Thunderbolt technology to deliver experiences like uncompressed screen
      sharing along with support for shared mouse and keyboard input between the
      PCs. This technology also allows users to transfer data between PCs in a
      drag-and-drop fashion.
