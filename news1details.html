      OpenAI leader resigns, accuses company of putting ‘shiny products’ above
      safety
    </h1>
    <p>
      According to Leike, OpenAI should spend more time on “getting ready for
      the next generations of models, on security, monitoring, preparedness,
      safety, adversarial robustness, (super)alignment, confidentiality,
      societal impact, and related topics,” and he is concerned that OpenAI is
      not on that trajectory.

      He also said, “Building smarter-than-human machines is an inherently
      dangerous endeavour,” hinting at the ongoing quest to develop AGI
      (artificial general intelligence), and that “OpenAI is shouldering an
      enormous responsibility on behalf of all of humanity.” According to Leike,
      “To ensure AGI benefits all of humanity, we must prioritize preparing for
      them as best we can,” and OpenAI is “long overdue in getting incredibly
      serious about the implications of AGI.

      his week also saw some major shake-ups at AWS and OpenAI. AWS CEO Adam
      Selipsky is stepping down and will be replaced by AWS sales chief Matt
      Garman. And OpenAI co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever
      has departed the company along with Jan Leike. Sutskever will be replaced
      by Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI’s director of research.
